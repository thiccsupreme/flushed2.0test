# FlushedBot

Welcome to *FlushedBot* 
    This bot was coded by *REDACTED*. To add this bot into your server, please [click here!](https://google.com) 

## About

> FlushedBot was a project I started about 6 months ago because I was interested in making a Discord bot for my friends and family server. With the help of some proficient developers in sneaker twitter, and my own previous knowledge of coding, I scraped together a small little project. 

## Usage

> My goal is to somehow scale this to be as large as Dyno, in a sense that it has a large variety of commands, customization options, and support, but being the sole developer, and only recently starting on this project, *FlushedBot* is still very limited in it's ability to perform like Dyno. With that out of the way, here is how my bot works: 

#### Moderation 
> Moderation is a key part of any discord server, and my bot brings a helping hand when it comes to this.
* Kick/Ban
* Mute
* Channel locking
* Clearing channels from spam
* Add and remove role

#### Fun 
> My discord bot has some fun tools you can use to kill time, settle bets, etc. 
* Rock paper scissors
* Coinflip
* Diceroll 
* Avatar command
* Dog and cat image scraper
* Instagram scraper
* Information about the author. 

#### Information
> Knowledge is power. My bot brings some informational tools to help out members if they need it. 
* Checking if the bot is up, and how long it has been up. 
* Checking SARS-COVID19 stats on every country in the world.
* Information about the server the bot is in, and much more!
* Crypto conversion rates to any currency.
* A spotify command that sends an embed with all the infomation about the currrent track of the author, or any othe user. 
* A delay calculator for Shopify sites.

#### Bot Information
> This is a more niche part of my Discord bot, pertaining more to sneaker resellers who use bots. I have compiled an expansive array of information about every sneaker/collectible bot out there. 

## Getting started 
> Once you have added this bot into your server, please use your server's #spam channel or #bot-spam to start setting up your bot. 
* *(For moderators, you will need a #logs channel somewhere in the server so that the bot can maximize it's potential)*. The logger detects new members, leaving members, deleted members, and edited messages (more is coming to this soon!). 
> Once you are in your #spam channel, use the command `?help`. Once done, the bot should DM the author an embed containing the full list of commands. Bot customization is coming shortly (i.e custom prefixes). 
* *(As of now (May 2020), the prefix is `?`. Please keep in mind that this bot is sneaker/sneaker botting oriented, so some commands may seem questionanble or completely irrelevant to your server's needs and purpose.)*
> Once you have roled the bot (it comes standard with `Administrator` privledges), you are all set. Please join the support server [here](https://google.com) for any issues that may arise with the bot.
