# FlushedBot

*Welcome to FlushedBot* 
    This bot was coded by <REDACTED>. To add this bot into your server, please [click here!](https://google.com) 

## About

> FlushedBot was a project I started about 6 months ago because I was interested in making a Discord bot for my friends and family server. With the help of some proficient developers in sneaker twitter, and my own previous knowledge of coding, I scraped together a small little project. 

## Usage

> My goal is to somehow scale this to be as large as Dyno, in a sense that it has a large variety of commands, customization options, and support, but being the sole developer, and only recently starting on this project, *FlushedBot* is still very limited in it's ability to perform like Dyno. With that out of the way, here is how my bot works: 

#### Moderation 
> Moderation is a key part of any discord server, and my bot brings a helping hand when it comes to this.
* Kick/Ban
* Mute
* Channel locking
* Clearing channels from spam

#### Fun 
> My discord bot has some fun tools you can use to kill time, settle bets, etc. 
* Rock paper scissors
* Coinflip
* Diceroll 
* Avatar command
* Dog and cat image scraper
* Instagram scraper
* Information about the author. 

#### Information
> Knowledge is power. My bot brings some informational tools to help out members if they need it. 
* Checking if the bot is up, and how long it has been up. 
* Checking SARS-COVID19 stats on every country in the world 
* Information about the server the bot is in, and much more!

## Getting started 
> **Once you have added this bot into your server, please use your server's #spam channel or #bot-spam to start setting up your bot. For moderators, you will need a #logs channel somewhere in the server so that the bot can maximize it's potential. The logger detects new members, leaving members, deleted members, and edited messages (more is coming to this soon!). Once you are in your #spam channel, use the command `?help`. Once done, the bot should DM the author an embed containing the full list of commands. Bot customization is coming shortly (i.e custom prefixes). As of now (May 2020), the prefix is `?`. Please keep in mind that this bot is sneaker/sneaker botting oriented, so some commands may seem questionanble or completely irrelevant to your server's needs and purpose, so please keep that in mind. Once you have roled the bot (it comes standard with `Administrator` privledges), you are all set. Please join the support server [here](https://google.com) for any issues that may arise with the bot.**
